# 📚 Vidya — AI Tutor for rural India

Vidya is an AI-based tutoring system designed to make quality education accessible even in low-bandwidth environments. It uses a custom **context pruning approach** to reduce unnecessary data processing, lowering LLM token usage by up to **85–92%** while still providing accurate answers from textbook content.

---

## 🌿 Overview

The project has two main components:

* **`index.html`** – A lightweight browser-based application where users can upload any textbook PDF and ask questions interactively.
* **`context_pruning_rag.ipynb`** – A Google Colab notebook that demonstrates the full pipeline and compares performance with a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## 🧠 Core Concept: Context Pruning

Traditional RAG systems retrieve multiple chunks of text for every query, often including irrelevant information. This increases both token usage and cost.

Vidya improves this by introducing **context pruning**, where the system first identifies the most relevant chapters before sending content to the language model.

### Workflow

1. The user asks a question
2. The system analyzes chapter titles and content using keyword matching
3. Only the top 1–2 relevant chapters are selected
4. Filtered content is sent to the LLM
5. The model generates a precise answer based on the selected context

This approach reduces the amount of text sent from around **40,000 tokens to ~3,000 tokens per query**.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Web Application

1. Get a free API key from Groq
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. Enter the API key
4. Upload a textbook PDF
5. Wait for the one-time OCR process
6. Start asking questions

The app uses **OCR (Tesseract.js)**, allowing it to work even with scanned or poorly encoded PDFs.

---

### Colab Notebook

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells in order
3. Upload a PDF file
4. Execute test queries
5. Compare results between baseline RAG and context pruning

A summary table shows token usage and cost savings for each query.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

### Web App

* PDF.js – renders PDF pages in the browser
* Tesseract.js – extracts text using OCR
* Groq API (LLaMA 3.1) – generates answers
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript – frontend implementation

### Notebook

* LangChain – builds the RAG pipeline
* FAISS – vector database for baseline retrieval
* HuggingFace Embeddings – semantic encoding
* pdfplumber / PyPDF – PDF text extraction
* LangChain-Groq – LLM integration

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Metric           | Baseline RAG | Context Pruning |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Tokens per query | ~40,000      | ~3,000          |
| Data sent        | ~160 KB      | ~12 KB          |
| Cost per query   | ~₹0.0166   | ~₹0.0012      |
| Reduction        | —            | 85–92%          |

## 🌐 Designed for Low-Bandwidth Use

* OCR runs only once during setup
* Each query sends minimal text (around 4–6 KB)
* No images are transmitted after processing
* Works efficiently even on slow internet connections

---

## 🔑 API Key Setup

1. Sign up on Groq
2. Generate an API key
3. Paste it into the web app or notebook

The free tier is sufficient for regular usage.

---

## 🧮 Chapter Selection Method

Instead of relying on embeddings for pruning, the system uses a lightweight scoring approach:

* Matches between question keywords and chapter titles are given higher weight
* Matches within chapter content are given lower weight

The top-ranked chapters are selected, and all others are ignored.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* OCR processes only a subset of pages per chapter
* Chapter detection depends on standard formatting
* API key is not stored permanently
* Refreshing the page requires reprocessing
